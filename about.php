<strong>The mission of Flash Flood Print Studios is two-fold</strong> – one, to provide exceptional commercial screen printing services for both textiles and flat stock and two, to serve as a community space and resource for those wanting to learn or those who wish to continue working with screen printing. We look forward to providing Tulsa with these resources and hope to be a part of a growing community of printers.</p>
<p>
The very beginnings of Flash Flood came about when I was still in undergrad. Recently obsessed with screen printing, I wondered why I didn't have any opportunities to try the medium when I was younger. The idea became further solidified when I graduated and moved back to Tulsa. I missed the facilities I had access to as a student and slowly began to build my own screen printing equipment so I could continue working in the medium.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't until 2012 that I teamed up with Nick Nold – whom I had met while working in a commercial t-shirt shop – and Flash Flood became a reality. We had both toyed with the idea of starting our own screen printing businesses separately, but thought our efforts would be doubly successful if we became partners. We registered the business in the balmy summer of 2012 and nearly a year later moved into our current studio in the Pearl District.
